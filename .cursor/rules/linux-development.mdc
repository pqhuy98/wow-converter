- Run the app with `npm run dev` as background daemon emitting logs to `log.txt`. Tail the log file, when the message `Serving UI web interface at http://127.0.0.1:3001/` appears means server started successfully. Always kill the old server on port 3000 and 3001 before starting a new one. Server `npm run dev` has hot-reload, so no need to kill every code change.
- wow.export is included only for code reference. Never locally and do not modify its code from this repository.
- Commit hygiene: squash commits before merging to `main`.
  ```bash
  git fetch origin
  git rebase -i origin/main   # squash
  git push -f <your-branch>
  ```
- Screenshots are mandatory in PR to provide proof of change correctness. Use Playwright MCP to make screenshot under `.playwright-mcp/`; copy into `docs/` before commit. Every change in PR must have a corresponding screenshot.
- When using playwright MCP to export model, fill in the fields, click Export Character and wait for text `Export Successful` 10s then 20s then 40s. If taking more than 40s then check browser error message.
- When taking screenshot of the exported model, click `â›¶` to expand, `setViewport(1440, 900)`.
- Documentation updates: before raising PR, always incorporate maintainer feedback into this file promptly. Keep it extremely compact and high-signal (short bullets over long prose).
