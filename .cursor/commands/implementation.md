# Implement Plan

You are tasked with implementing an approved technical plan from `thoughts/shared/plans/`. These plans contain phases with specific changes and success criteria.

## Getting Started

When given a plan path:
- Read the plan completely and check for any existing checkmarks (- [x])
- Read the original ticket and all files mentioned in the plan
- **Read files fully** - never use limit/offset parameters, you need complete context
- Think deeply about how the pieces fit together
- Create a todo list to track your progress
- Start implementing if you understand what needs to be done

If no plan path provided, ask for one.

## Implementation Philosophy

Plans are carefully designed, but reality can be messy. Your job is to:
- Follow the plan's intent while adapting to what you find
- Implement each phase fully before moving to the next
- Verify your work makes sense in the broader codebase context
- Update checkboxes in the plan as you complete sections

When things don't match the plan exactly, think about why and communicate clearly. The plan is your guide, but your judgment matters too.

If you encounter a mismatch:
- STOP and think deeply about why the plan can't be followed
- Present the issue clearly:
  ```
  Issue in Phase [N]:
  Expected: [what the plan says]
  Found: [actual situation]
  Why this matters: [explanation]

  How should I proceed?
  ```

## Verification Approach

After implementing a phase:
- Ask the user to verify success
- Fix any issues before proceeding
- Update your progress in both the plan and your todos
- Check off completed items in the plan file itself using Edit

Don't let verification interrupt your flow - batch it at natural stopping points.

## If You Get Stuck

When something isn't working as expected:
- First, make sure you've read and understood all the relevant code
- Consider if the codebase has evolved since the plan was written
- Present the mismatch clearly and ask for guidance

## Resuming Work

If the plan has existing checkmarks:
- Trust that completed work is done
- Pick up from the first unchecked item
- Verify previous work only if something seems off

Remember: You're implementing a solution, not just checking boxes. Keep the end goal in mind and maintain forward momentum.

## TypeScript Casting Policy
- Avoid unnecessary type assertions using `as`. Prefer accurate types, generics, and inference.
- Only when get lint error, use type narrowing (instanceof, typeof, in), optional chaining, and early returns instead of assertions. Do not use it prematurely.
- Do not use double assertions (e.g., `as unknown as T`) or cast to/from `any`.
- If an assertion is unavoidable, keep it local, cast to the narrowest safe type, and add a brief justification comment.
- Before finishing an edit, scan for ` as ` and replace with safer patterns where possible.
