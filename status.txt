TODO (not in any priority order):
- NPCs don't close hand when holding items
- Multi-step workflow in web to tune the model:
  - First export for full model with all data
  - Select different animations before final export
    - Basic animations auto-chosen, also smaller list, currently a lot of Spell/Spell Slam...
    - List of extra anims grouped by theme, e.g. attack, custom spell...
- Map generation crashes when map too big and height min-max diff so high
- Auto-updater for wow-converter to keep users up-to-date.
- Collect anonymous analytics to understand common usage patterns.
- Handle adhoc requests with post-processing script and AI prompt to help generate script.
- Option to export textures as DDS

BLOCKED:
- Some later models have advanced materials e.g. firehawk that requires UV2 layer that Wc3 doesn't have.
- Model infernal2 has incorrect geoset anims for the glow: wow.export didn't has this data, not sure why.
- Some anims are broken not sure why, but works on WoW Classic.
