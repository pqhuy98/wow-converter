TODO (not in any priority order):
- Character customization collection e.g. mechagnome, earthen,... is not exported.
- NPCs don't close hand when holding items
- Multi-step workflow in web to tune the model:
  - First export for full model with all data
  - Select different animations before final export
    - Basic animations auto-chosen, also smaller list, currently a lot of Spell/Spell Slam...
    - List of extra anims grouped by theme, e.g. attack, custom spell...
- Some creatures using textures not in DB skin list cannot be exported because skin not found.
- Map generation crashes when map too big and height min-max diff so high
- Support for wowhead dressing room.
- Auto-updater for wow-converter to keep users up-to-date.
- Collect anonymous analytics to understand common usage patterns.

DONE:
- Feet and trouser geoset wrong in some cases
- Bug: inputting new URLs into base/itme input box doesn't update React state.
- Collision box right now too big. Try to choose best that fit the Stand anim.
- Some users want matrix model version 800
- Basic particles
- Bug: doesn't work for some user with existing wow.export settings from the official.
  e.g. when they have exportModelFormat: "RAW" while wow-converter fails to change wow.export config during startup. (why? it should!).
- Export classic models.
- Item collections are exported.
- Models now have ears 
- All attachments work correctly

BLOCKED:
- Blood elf model's attachment not working
  Reason: wow.export bones and attachment data is wrong, not sure if any other data source for replacement.
- Some later models have advanced materials e.g. firehawk that requires UV2 layer that Wc3 doesn't have.
- Model infernal2 has incorrect geoset anims for the glow: wow.export didn't has this data, not sure why.
- https://www.wowhead.com/npc=16867/shattered-hand-grunt this orc has wrong eye textures
  Reason: cannot find texture file ID in wowhead data, even after searching in network requests in Chrome network inspection. 

BUGS:
