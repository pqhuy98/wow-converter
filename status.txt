TODO (not in any priority order):
- Some users want matrix model version 800
- In later expansions. some NPCs with collection e.g. mechagnome, earthen,... cannot be fully exported.
- NPCs don't close hand when holding items
- Multi-step workflow in web to tune the model:
  - First export for full model with all data
  - Select different animations before final export
    - Basic animations auto-chosen, also smaller list, currently a lot of Spell/Spell Slam...
    - List of extra anims grouped by theme, e.g. attack, custom spell...
- Collision box right now too big. Try to choose best that fit the Stand anim.
- Some creatures using textures not in DB skin list cannot be exported because skin not found.
- Map generation crashes when map too big and height min-max diff so high
- Support for wowhead dressing room.
- Auto-updater for wow-converter to keep users up-to-date.
- Collect anonymous analytics to understand common usage patterns.
- Use correct model ID for character export based on wowhead URL of different expansions.

DONE:
- Feet and trouser geoset wrong in some cases

BLOCKED:
- Blood elf model's attachment not working
  Reason: wow.export bones and attachment data is wrong, not sure if any other data source for replacement.
- Some later models have advanced materials e.g. firehawk that requires UV2 layer that Wc3 doesn't have.

BUGS:
- Doesn't work for some user with existing wow.export settings from the official.
  e.g. when they have exportModelFormat: "RAW" while wow-converter fails to change wow.export config during startup. (why? it should!).
